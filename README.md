# RNA-sequencing pipeline to analyze differentially expressed genes based on different breast-cancer genotypes
1. Checking read-quality using fastqc
2. Mapping reads to the reference genome using hisat2
4. Count number of reads per gene with featureCounts
5. Create a differential gene expression analysis using the DESeq2 R-package
